                            <p>Organisations should be aware that data considered 'de-identified' in one context may not remain de-identified in another. For example, unit record synthetic data in a restricted, protected environment may be considered 'effectively de-identified' within that environment, but if the same data were published publicly or subject to a data breach, the risk of re-identification may increase.</p>

                            <h5>Dynamic re-identification risk</h5>
                            <p>Re-identification risk should not be considered 'static'. Organisations will need to re-assess re-identification risk where there are changes relating to the data, the environment, or other relevant factors. Other factors may also impact or heighten the risk, such as if the source dataset and/or the trained model used to generate the synthetic dataset were exposed or made available to users who have access to the synthetic dataset.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Further, 'identifiability' in law does not necessarily imply that a person's name or legal identity can be established from the information. The Australian Privacy Commissioner has said that: "Generally speaking, an individual is 'identified' when, within a group of persons, he or she is 'distinguished' from all other members of a group."</p>

                            <p>From a practical perspective, the range of other exemptions which can authorise organisations to collect, use or disclose health information in a manner not otherwise permitted under their privacy obligations are not relevant for synthetic data projects – particularly where privacy laws already have special exemptions designed for research projects and management of healthcare activities.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Privacy laws also provide other exemptions which can authorise the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, although they will not be relevant for synthetic data projects. These exemptions include, for example, for law enforcement purposes, where there is a serious threat to life, health or safety, and in the cases of missing persons.</p>

                        <p>Specifically for the handling of health information, there are also exceptions which pertain to the provision of healthcare services to the individual about whom the information relates. For example, there are exceptions that allow a health service provider to share the patient's health information amongst a treatment team, or with family members in certain circumstances.</p>
