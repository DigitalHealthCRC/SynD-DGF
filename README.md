## Chatbot Integration

The site includes an OpenAI ChatKit-powered AI assistant on all pages.

### Quick Setup 

Prerequisites:
- OpenAI account with API access
- Cloudflare account (free tier)
- Node.js 18+ installed

Steps:

1. Create OpenAI Agent Workflow 
   - Visit https://platform.openai.com/agent-builder
   - Create workflow: "SynD-DGF Assistant"
   - Add training data from website URL or docs
   - Publish and copy workflow ID

2. Deploy Cloudflare Worker 
   ```bash
   cd cloudflare-worker
   npm install
   npx wrangler login
   npx wrangler deploy

   # Set secrets
   npx wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
   npx wrangler secret put CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID
   ```

3. Configure Chatbot 
   - Update `assets/chatbot/chatbot.js` with your worker URL

4. Add domain to OpenAI allowlist
   - Visit: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/security/domain-allowlist
   - Add your GitHub Pages URL and localhost

5. Deploy 
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure chatbot"
   git push origin master
   ```

### Troubleshooting Chatbot

Worker returns error:
- Check logs: `npx wrangler tail`
- Verify secrets: `npx wrangler secret list`

Widget shows connection error:
- Test worker endpoint with curl
- Verify worker URL in chatbot.js

Widget is blank:
- Add domain to OpenAI allowlist
- Wait 2-3 minutes
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
