## Method

Used a Python script (`remove_emojis.py`) to:
1. Scan all HTML files for emojis using comprehensive Unicode ranges
2. Preserve only the three approved emojis (⚠️, ✗, ✓)
3. Remove all other emoji characters
4. Generate detailed reports for verification

## Files Modified

22 HTML files were modified during the emoji removal process:

**about/ directory:**
- contact.html (removed 11 emojis)
- framework.html (removed emojis from feature icons)
- methodology.html (removed research icons)
- stakeholder-consultation.html (removed stakeholder icons)

**decision-support/ directory:**
- legal-pathways-wizard.html (removed button emojis)
- risk-mitigation-planner.html (removed framework and action button emojis)
- decision-support.html (removed tool icons)

**framework/ directory:**
- All 5 step files were processed (kept only approved emojis in headings)

**resources/appendices/ directory:**
- Multiple appendix files were processed

**tools/ directory:**
- All 8 tool files were processed

**root directory:**
- Several root-level HTML files were processed

## Icon Replacements

For sections where emojis were used as decorative icons (e.g., contact cards, feature icons), the emojis were removed from `<span class="contact-icon">` or `<div class="feature-icon">` elements, leaving empty elements.

The site already uses Lucide Icons (loaded via `<script src="https://unpkg.com/lucide@latest"></script>`), which can be used for future icon needs instead of emojis.

## Verification

Verification was performed using `verify_emojis.py` script which:
- Scanned all 42 HTML files
- Confirmed only approved emojis remain
- Verified proper usage of kept emojis
- Generated detailed breakdown by file

**Verification Results:**
- ✓ All unwanted emojis successfully removed
- ✓ All kept emojis are from the approved list
- ✓ Total of 47 approved emoji occurrences remain
- ✓ No issues encountered

## Recommendations

1. **Icon Library:** Use Lucide Icons (already loaded) for future decorative icons instead of emojis
2. **Consistency:** The three kept emojis (⚠️, ✗, ✓) are used appropriately for:
   - Warning indicators (⚠️)
   - Success/completion indicators (✓)
   - Failure/stop indicators (✗)
3. **Future Development:** Avoid using emojis for decorative purposes; use CSS-based icons or icon libraries

## Files Generated

1. **remove_emojis.py** - Main script to remove emojis
2. **verify_emojis.py** - Verification script
3. **emoji_report.txt** - Detailed verification report
4. **EMOJI_REMOVAL_FINAL_REPORT.md** - This comprehensive report

## Conclusion

All emojis have been successfully removed from the SynD-DGF website HTML files, with the exception of the three approved emojis (⚠️, ✗, ✓) which remain for their semantic meaning in framework guidance and assessment outcomes.

The website maintains a clean, professional appearance while preserving the meaningful use of warning, success, and failure indicators where appropriate.
