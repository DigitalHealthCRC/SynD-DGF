## 9. Conclusion

The current website provides an excellent foundation with good content organisation and innovative interactive tools. The main opportunity lies in incorporating the comprehensive guidance and detailed assessments from the framework appendices while maintaining the website's user-friendly approach.

### Key Recommendations:
1. **Prioritise legal and assessment content** - these are the most critical gaps
2. **Maintain website's interactive strengths** while adding framework depth
3. **Restructure resources section** to better organise the expanded content
4. **Ensure mobile-first approach** for all new content additions

The website already exceeds the framework in user experience and interactivity - the goal should be to match the framework's comprehensiveness while maintaining these UX advantages.
