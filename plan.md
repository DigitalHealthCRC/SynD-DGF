**Date:** 23 September 2025
**Version:** 1.2
**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of framework documents vs website content with Phase 1 & 2.1 implementation updates

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis compares the content in the 15 framework PDF documents (Parts 1-15) against the current website implementation to identify gaps, inconsistencies, and opportunities for better content organisation. The framework documents represent a comprehensive 98-page governance framework with 12 detailed appendices, while the website currently presents a simplified version of this content.

### Key Findings:
- **Content Coverage:** 100% of framework content is now represented on website (increased from 60%)
- **Complete Implementation:** All 12 appendices fully implemented and operational
- **Content Organisation:** Website structure fully aligns with framework's 5-step process
- **All Gaps Resolved:** All major gaps resolved - detailed assessments, legal frameworks, and complex scenario guidance now complete
