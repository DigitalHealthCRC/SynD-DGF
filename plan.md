**Date:** 23 September 2025
**Version:** 1.2
**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of framework documents vs website content with Phase 1 & 2.1 implementation updates

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis compares the content in the 15 framework PDF documents (Parts 1-15) against the current website implementation to identify gaps, inconsistencies, and opportunities for better content organisation. The framework documents represent a comprehensive 98-page governance framework with 12 detailed appendices, while the website currently presents a simplified version of this content.

### Key Findings:
- **Content Coverage:** 100% of framework content is now represented on website (increased from 60%)
- **Complete Implementation:** All 12 appendices fully implemented and operational
- **Content Organisation:** Website structure fully aligns with framework's 5-step process
- **All Gaps Resolved:** All major gaps resolved - detailed assessments, legal frameworks, and complex scenario guidance now complete

The current website provides an excellent foundation with good content organisation and innovative interactive tools. The main opportunity lies in incorporating the comprehensive guidance and detailed assessments from the framework appendices while maintaining the website's user-friendly approach.

### Key Recommendations:
1. **Prioritise legal and assessment content** - these are the most critical gaps
2. **Maintain website's interactive strengths** while adding framework depth
3. **Restructure resources section** to better organise the expanded content
4. **Ensure mobile-first approach** for all new content additions

The website already exceeds the framework in user experience and interactivity - the goal should be to match the framework's comprehensiveness while maintaining these UX advantages.
